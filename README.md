# PyCitySchools Data Analysis Challenge

This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook file named `PyCitySchools.ipynb`, where I conducted a comprehensive data analysis on student performance and school data. The analysis involved exploring various variables, calculating statistics, and deriving insights to gain a better understanding of a city's educational landscape.

## Dataset 

The analysis was performed using two datasets:

1. `schools_complete.csv`: This CSV file contains information about different schools in the city, including their names, types, budgets, and sizes.

2. `students_complete.csv`: This CSV file includes data on individual students, such as their names, gender, grade levels, subject scores, and the schools they attend.

Both datasets can be found in the `Resources` folder.

## Jupyter Notebook

The main analysis was conducted in the Jupyter Notebook file `PyCitySchools.ipynb`. In this notebook, I utilized Python, along with the `pandas` and `pathlib` libraries, to perform data manipulation, analysis, and calculations.

The notebook contains step-by-step code blocks explaining how I performed the analysis and the corresponding observations and insights.
